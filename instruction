**Bug Verification Task**

I will provide:
- **Solver**: (z3 or cvc5)
- **Suspect commit**: (commit hash where bug may have been introduced)
- **Fix commits**: (one or more commit hashes that fixed the issue)
- **Test case**: (SMT-LIB code that triggers the bug)
- **Fix diff** (optional): (code changes that fixed the issue)

**Your task**: Using git history analysis on the existing repository at `/Users/andrei.zhukov/study/thesis/fmfuzz-evaluation/{solver}`, determine:
1. Was the bug introduced in the suspect commit?
2. Does the fix directly address the issue introduced by that commit?
3. What specifically changed between the buggy and fixed versions?

**Requirements**:
- Use git commands only (git log, git show, git blame, git diff)
- No code execution or building
- NO file writing
- Output all analysis and findings directly in chat

**Example input format**:
```
Solver: z3
Suspect commit: abc123...
Fix commits: def456..., ghi789...

Test case:
(assert ...)
(check-sat)

Fix diff (optional):
-    old_code();
+    new_code();
```
